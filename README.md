# SimpleAgent

The idea behind this project is to help beginners write agents.  Current projects like autogen are not good starting examples for beginners.  There is too much code.  These examples should be easy to understand.  My hope is that, consequently, more people will write agents.

Conversation.py may be the simplest possible two agent program that uses a local model.  
I've also added some additional versions with increading complexityr; so conversation3.py is more complex than conversation2.py. I'm using Ollama to run local models as it is the simplest possible way to get started running local models.
